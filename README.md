# XOR Classifier With Neural Net

I have implemented a classifier that can classify a given input as a 1 or 0. The classifier is a neural network with a single hidden layer. The hidden layer has a sigmoid activation function. The output layer has a sigmoid activation function. The classifier is trained using the XOR dataset.

| X1    | X2  | y
| ----- | --- | ---
| 0     | 0  | 0
| 0     | 1  | 1
| 1     | 0  | 1
| 1     |  1 | 0

I implemented with PyTorch. For the optimizer, I have used the Adam optimizer.
